This is a framework for developing and running basic ARM assembly programs.

All .s files must be formatted with the exact following spacing on each line:
```
mov r1, #5
MOV r2, r1
add r1, r2, r3
 ````
Each instruction may be capitalised or lowercase. View the 'demo.s' file for further syntax examples

Currently can be run by specifying the desired .s file at the bottom of 'main.py' and running it.

Currently implementing suffixes and branching
